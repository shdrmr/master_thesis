\chapter{Introduction}

When it comes to hard real time systems, the execution time of the program plays an important role in determining the stability and failure rate of the system. This is because real time systems have hard deadlines, which they have to meet in order to meet the required functionality. Furthermore, precise determination of these deadlines play a crucial role during the design phase of the system. Software running in these systems must be written in such a way that it meets these deadlines. 
\section{Things to mention}

\begin{itemize}
  \item something about performance optimization and why it is needed in dsp
  \item start with vectorization and what it does, simd and mimd
  \item what a real time system is and how dsp plays a role
  \item Some arm Architecture stuff, pipeline, fpu, neon, cache 
  \item some neon stuff
  \item some stuff about the problem statement and possible solutions
  \item some stuff about the approach i took in the thesis
  \item some stuff about the summary of the following sections
  \item some things about
